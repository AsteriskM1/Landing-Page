# Landing-Page

A Landing Page for ShoeBrand. Made it from a tutorial to re-learn the basics of CSS and also to gain knowledge of common CSS properties that are actually used in projects.

Also learned about Sass and how to use it. 
Learned how to transform a Figma design to an actual website.

Some minor changes I made:

Resized the menu within 920 px. From 50% to 35%.
Changed arrow key to black in all size.

Changes I want to make to this:

Make it a place where you can actually shop for shoes and related items. Basically, make it into a ecommerce website.
